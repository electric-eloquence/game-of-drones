### attr(attributes)
Set one or more attributes for all matches.

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| attributes | `object` | An object of attribute:value pairs. A string value will add or update the corresponding attribute. A null value will remove the corresponding attribute. |

### before(...content)
Add HTML content immediately before all matches.

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ...content | `string`\|`object`\|`array` | A string, a DOM (or DOM-like) element, a jQuery/Cheerio component, an array thereof, or a comma-separated combination thereof. |

### css(properties)
Set one or more CSS properties for all matches.

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| properties | `object` | An object of property:value pairs to set. |

### css(properties)
Update `state.style` with the computed style of the actual element. Requerio
does not preemptively set all styles on the state, given how wasteful that would
be across all styles across all organisms.

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| properties | `string`\|`string[]` | The name or names of properties to get from the element, and set on the state. |

### data(keyValues)
Set one or more key:value pairs of data. Does not affect HTML attributes in the
DOM.

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| keyValues | `object` | An object of key:value pairs. |

### detach()
Remove all matches from the DOM, but keep in memory in case they need to be reattached.

### empty()
Empty innerHTML of all matches.

### height(value)
Set the height (not including padding, border, or margin) of all matches.

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| value | `number`\|`string`\|`function` | The number of CSS pixels, a string representing the measurement, or a function returning the measurement. |

### html(htmlString)
Set the innerHTML of all matches.

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| htmlString | `string` | A string of HTML. Functions are not supported. |

### html()
Dispatching an 'html' action without an htmlString parameter will set
`state.innerHTML` to the string value of the innerHTML of the actual element.
Prior to that, `state.innerHTML` will be null. Simply invoking `.getState()`
where `state.innerHTML` is null will not update `state.innerHTML`. However,
once `state.innerHTML` has been set to a string, subsequent invocations of
`.getState()` will update `state.innerHTML`. Set `state.innerHTML` only when
necessary, since very large innerHTML strings across many organisms with many
members can add up to a large amount of data.

### innerHeight(value)
Set the innerHeight (including padding, but not border or margin) of all
matches.

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| value | `number`\|`string`\|`function` | The number of CSS pixels, a string representing the measurement, or a function returning the measurement. |

### innerWidth(value)
Set the innerWidth (including padding, but not border or margin) of all
matches.

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| value | `number`\|`string`\|`function` | The number of CSS pixels, a string representing the measurement, or a function returning the measurement. |

### prepend(...content)
Prepend HTML content to the innerHTML of all matches.

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ...content | `string`\|`object`\|`array` | A string, a DOM (or DOM-like) element, a jQuery/Cheerio component, an array thereof, or a comma-separated combination thereof. |

### prepend(content)
Prepend HTML content to the innerHTML of all matches.

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| content | `function` | A function that returns an HTML string. |

### prop(properties)
Set one or more properties for all matches. See https://api.jquery.com/prop/
for important distinctions between attributes and properties.

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| properties | `object` | An object of property:value pairs. |

### remove()
Remove all matches from the DOM, and from memory.

### removeClass(classes)
For each submitted class, remove that class from all matches which have that
class.

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| classes | `string`\|`function` | A space-separated string, or a function that returns a space-separated string. |

### removeData(name)
Remove a previously-stored piece of data. Does not affect HTML attributes in the
DOM.

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name | `string` | A string naming the piece of data to delete. |

### removeData(list)
Remove previously-stored pieces of data. Does not affect HTML attributes in the
DOM.

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| list | `string`\|`array` | A space-separated string or an array naming the pieces of data to delete. |

### scrollTop(value)
Set the vertical scroll position (the number of CSS pixels that are hidden from
view above the scrollable area) of the match.

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| value | `number` | The number to set the scroll position to. |

### setActiveOrganism(selector)
Only applicable if 'document' is an incepted organism. When a 'focus' action is
dispatched by an organism, this sets the 'document' organism's
`state.activeOrganism` to the selector of the focused organism. The
'setActiveOrganism' action can only be dispatched by the 'document' organism.

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| selector | `string` | The identifying selector of the focused organism. |

### setBoundingClientRect(boundingClientRect)
Copy properties of the boundingClientRect parameter over the corresponding
properties on `state.boundingClientRect`.

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| boundingClientRect | `object` | An object of key:values. The object may contain one or more properties, but they must correspond to properties defined by the [`DOMRect`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMRect) class, with the exception of `.x` and `.y` (as per compatibility with Microsoft browsers). |

### text(text)
Set the textContent of all matches. This is a safer way to change text on the DOM than dispatching an 'html' action.

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| text | `string` | A string of text. Functions are not supported. |

### text()
Dispatching a 'text' action without a parameter will set `state.textContent` to
the string value of the textContent of the actual element. Prior to that,
`state.textContent` will be null. Simply invoking `.getState()` where
`state.textContent` is null will not update `state.textContent`. However, once
`state.textContent` has been set to a string, subsequent invocations of
`.getState()` will update `state.textContent`. Set `state.textContent` only when
necessary, since very large text strings across many organisms with many members
can add up to a large amount of data.

### toggleClass(classes)
For each submitted class, add or remove that class from all matches, depending
on whether or not the member has that class.

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| classes | `string`\|`function` | A space-separated string, or a function that returns a space-separated string. |

### toggleClass(paramsArray)
For each submitted class, add or remove that class from all matches, depending
on a true/false switch.

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| paramsArray | `array` | An array: where element 0 is a space-separated string, or a function that returns a space-separated string; and element 1 is a boolean switch, where true means add, false means remove. |

### val(value)
Set the value of all matches, typically form fields. This will set `state.value`.

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| value | `string`\|`number` | The value to which to set the form field's value. Functions are not supported. |

### width(value)
Set the width (not including padding, border, or margin) of all matches.

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| value | `number`\|`string`\|`function` | The number of CSS pixels, a string representing the measurement, or a function returning the measurement. |

### blur()
Remove focus from the specified element, if that element has focus.
If there is a 'document' organism and it has `state.activeOrganism` set, unset that property.

### focus()
Set focus on the specified element, if that element can take focus. If it can take focus, and if there is a 'document'
organism, set the focused organism's selector as `state.activeOrganism`.
